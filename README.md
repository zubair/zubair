### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I grew up in Chicago where I played a bunch of computer games and began questioning how they were built. In third grade, I downloaded M.U.G.E.N., a freeware 2D fighting game engine and it was my first experience altering source code. As I got older, I successfully altered the source code of EA Sportâ€™s MVP Baseball 2005 Demo to have variable batting stances, shorter baseball players and bigger bats. It inspired me to think deeply about computers and how they work. 

Fast forward 15 years, I am a software engineer based in California ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ specialized in iOS with over 6 years of industry experience in financial services, AI, integrated fitness, e-commerce, wellness services and video streaming enhancing consumer mobile apps used by millions of users.

I enjoy building great products and I have always believed in augmenting humans with technology. I am looking for my next interesting opportunity, iterating on different methodologies and technologies such as building modern iOS architecture using Swift, UIKit, or SwiftUI to develop new features, buttery-smooth UI, and debug existing challenges.
